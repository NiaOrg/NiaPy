Nature-inspired algorithms are a very popular tool for solving optimization problems.
Since the beginning of their era, numerous variants of nature-inspired algorithms were
developed (`paper 1 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4186>`_, `paper 2 <https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/9/1521>`_).
To prove their versatility, those were tested in various domains on various applications,
especially when they are hybridized, modified or adapted. However, implementation of
nature-inspired algorithms is sometimes difficult, complex and tedious task. In order to break
this wall, NiaPy is intended for simple and quick use, without spending a time for
implementing algorithms from scratch.
