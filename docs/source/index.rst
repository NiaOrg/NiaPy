NiaPy's documentation
=================================

.. automodule:: NiaPy

Nature-inspired algorithms are a very popular tool for solving optimization problems.
Since the beginning of their era, numerous variants of `nature-inspired algorithms were
developed <https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4186>`_. To prove their versatility, those were
tested in various domains on various applications, especially when they are hybridized,
modified or adapted. However, implementation of nature-inspired algorithms is sometimes
difficult, complex and tedious task. In order to break this wall, NiaPy is intended for
simple and quick use, without spending a time for implementing algorithms from scratch.

The main documentation is organized into a couple sections:

* :ref:`user-docs`
* :ref:`dev-docs`
* :ref:`about-docs`
