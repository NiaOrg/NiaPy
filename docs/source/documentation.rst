Documentation
=============

.. note::

    We suppose that you already followed the :doc:`/installation` guide. If not, please do so
    before you continue to read this section.

To locally generate the documentation run the following command in the project root folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run sphinx-build docs/source docs/_build

You can then view it by opening docs/_build/index.html in your browser
