About
=====

Nature-inspired algorithms are a very popular tool for solving optimization problems. 
Since the beginning of their era, numerous variants of `nature-inspired algorithms were 
developed <https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4186>`_. To prove their versatility, those were 
tested in various domains on various applications, especially when they are hybridized, 
modified or adapted. However, implementation of nature-inspired algorithms is sometimes 
difficult, complex and tedious task. In order to break this wall, NiaPy is intended for 
simple and quick use, without spending a time for implementing algorithms from scratch.

Mission
-------
Our mission is to build a collection of nature-inspired algorithms and create a simple 
interface for managing the optimization process along with statistical evaluation. 
NiaPy will offer:

- numerous benchmark functions implementations,
- use of various nature-inspired algorithms without struggle and effort with a simple interface and
- easy comparison between nature-inspired algorithms
